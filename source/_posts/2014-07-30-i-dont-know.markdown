  An interesting thing happened today at work.
  <br />
  <br />
  There was a company wide all-hands meeting this evening, this is where the executives review our past quarter performance and reveal the all important number that everyone is most interested in - the bonus payout percentage. However, it is not the bonus payout percentage that is interesting... what caught my attention is a quick, short comment made by the CEO which could be paraphrased into: a CEO should not say "I don't know".
  <br />
  <br />
  It took me by surprise, as I am trying to learn to say "I don't know" more often!
  You know what I mean - it is really hard to say/admit "I don't know" at work as there is almost always a pressure to deliver some kind of an answer or to look good/save face in a meeting. Sometimes it is ignorance and sometimes it is just not enough available information - but I believe saying "I don't know" is one of the most honest, courageous and confident action one can make. I would rather see a leader readily admits to his/her lack of understanding than for a facade of omniscience.
