  Should browsers <i>disable</i> or <i>enable</i> 3rd-party cookies by default?
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Introduction</b>
  <br />
  While third-party cookies enable new web functionalities, it can also expose users’ browsing 
  history without users’ awareness. A person’s web history inevitably reveals personal 
  information, which could be maliciously exploited for economical and/or psychological harm.
  Furthermore, users’ obliviousness impedes the use of market force to regulate these third 
  parties. To address this ecosystem deficiency, browsers should disable third-party cookies by 
  default – requiring users to explicitly "opt-in".
