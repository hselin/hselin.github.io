  It's been 3 month since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">HeartBleed</a> was publicly disclosed.
  According to Wikipedia ~17% of secure web servers were believed to be vulnerable.
  <br />
  <br />
  That makes me wonder - what is the affect of our increasing reliance on a few well known libraries for application functionalities?
  Will this limit the "genetic diversity" of our software ecosystem?
  <br />
  <br />
  On one hand, as long as we take good care of our libraries this reduces the amount of development, test, and inter-op costs and also prevents amateur mistakes. It's akin to putting our eggs in a few selected baskets and taking good care of them (I stole this phrase from Prof. Cheriton). But what happens when you drop a basket? A major bug in a library could have devastating results for the whole ecosystem as it might be used by a significant number of applications.
